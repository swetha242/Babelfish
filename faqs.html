	<p>1)What is babelfish?</p>
	<div class='faa' id="a1">
	<p class='ans'>Babelfish is one of the largest online learning platforms for Spanish. 
		Babelfish's adaptive experience has gamified elements to make the learning of Spanish more fun and effective.
		100 million students are learning a language with Babelfish.</p>

	<div class="faq" onclick="fn('a2')">
	<p>2)How much does Babelfish cost?</p>
	<div class='faa' id="a2">
	<p class='ans'>Learning Spanish with Babelfish is absolutely 
		free of cost. However, if you want to expand your learning beyond the first level 
		to higher levels, we'd suggest you have a look at our payment packages-and avail a lot of discounts too!</p>

	<div class="faq"  onclick="fn('a3')">
	<p>3)Is my information safe?</p>
	<div class='faa' id="a3">
	<p class='ans'>When you create a Babelfish account, you choose a username and provclasse us with an email address,
		which is not public. The username/name you chose can be seen by other users of Babelfish. 
		We do not sell or share personal account information with third parties.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<div class="faq"  onclick="fn('a4')">
	<p>4)Why choose Babelfish?</p>
	<div class='faa' id="a4">
	<p class='ans'>In Babelfish, we guarantee that all lessons are tailored specifically to meet the requirements of 
		the Spanish language. The way an English speaker learns Spanish, for example, is different than the way
		an Italian speaker learns it. This way our customers benefit from useful content with a maximum learning effect.</p>

	<div class="faq"  onclick="fn('a6')">
	<p>5)What is the teaching method?</p>
	<div class='faa' id="a6">
	<p class='ans'>Babelfish is a self-study platform and there are no teachers, instead you learn from our 
		self-study exercises and from other members of the community. Each course contains sets of 
		lessons designed around a particular topic (for example: introducing yourself). The focus of each 
		exercise within a lesson is to give you something new (usually a word or a phrase) that you can use 
		immediately in writing or conversation.You are updated about your progress at each level.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="faq"  onclick="fn('a7')">
	<p>6)How do I use Babelfish?</p>
	<div class='faa' id="a7">
	<p class='ans'>A lesson consists of three levels-one, exercise, which is basically a set of flashcards containing 
		important phrases or sentences pertaining to that lesson(e.g about me). The second, a quiz, which tests how 
		much you have learnt. And, finally, after all lessons, there is also a final quiz with mixed varieties of questions 
		to track your progress.</p>

	<p>7)How do I login?</p>
	<div class='faa' id="a8">
	<p class='ans'>Click the "Log in" button. Enter your email and password combination. You'll be redirected to your
		dashboard where you'll be able to see your progress and continue learning where you left off. If you are 
		a new user, please sign up, and enter all required details.</p>
